## DASHBOT

You're a busy person, you travel a lot for work and are always on the go, but you always try to stay in the 'know'. With Dashbot we're excited to bring you an easy-to-use and friendly application to keep you up to date on top news stories in the US, your local weather, Meetups in your location, and for you to search for your favorite books!

This application is easy to use, but we'd love to give you some inside tips for keeping your information saved to your favorites!

1. Login with your Google account in the top right corner of Dashbot, this way you can start saving your favorite items!
1. News Articles are live, so they will change as they are entered in throughout the US. The first four are listed on the home page, but if you'd like to see the Top 10 Headlining Stories in the US, be sure to click on the button below those first few articles.
1. If you'd like to save a news article to read later, click on the 'favorite heart' next to the link to see the full article.
1. Your home weather in Nashville will always load when you enter into the application. We hope that soon you can enter in your current zipcode to get that weather too. Check back soon for that feature in version 2!
1. You're on the road a lot, so that can get pretty boring, and we get it! Search your favorite books in our archive of books just below the news articles on the home page.
1. We have high hopes that any minute now we will get local Meetup Events displaying, depending on the zipcode you enter for the weather! Stay tuned for that as well.
