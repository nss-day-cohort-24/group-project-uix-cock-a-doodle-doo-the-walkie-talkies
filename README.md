# Cock-A-Doodle-Doo - Group Project

## Summary

Your group will create a Single Page Application that is essentially a dashboard for a user to use when they wake up in the morning to keep track of the weather, news, etc.


## Getting Started

> **Pro Tip:** If you find yourself writing logic on the first day of the sprint, then you did not spend enough time planning, and gaining clarification on the acceptance criteria.

1. Be sure to review your design requirements [here](https://sites.google.com/susanculkin.com/fewdd-b/design-subjects/week-10). 
1. Review the [product owner's tickets](https://github.com/nashville-software-school/group-project-uix-cock-a-doodle-doo/issues).
1. Create Firebase account for your team to use in this application.
1. Be sure to set your Firebase rules for indexing.
1. Make sure you spend time defining MVP and creating a plan to reach that goal.



## Technical Considerations
* You will be getting data from different APIs.
* User authentication using Firebase.
* The application must have CRUD functionality with the Firebase database.
* Consider encapsulating all Firebase calls into a single module.
* Use SASS to control your color themes.
* Incorporate a CSS grid framework

## Technology Requirements
* SASS 
* Grunt (with JSHINT) 
* Promises
* Browserify
* Grid framework of your choice
* Firebase for data storage and retrieval
